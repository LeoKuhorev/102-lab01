## Day 05 "COMPUTER LOGIC AND LOOPS" 

**WHAT DOES EVERY COMPUTER DO?**
- Input;  
- Storage;  
- Processing;  
- Output;

**3 TYPES OF _LOOPS_:**  
- **FOR** - uses counter, use if you know how many times your code should be repeated;  
- **WHILE** - condition can be anything else (not counter);  
- **DO WHILE** - even if the condition returns false  - will run the code once;  
        `do {`  
            `your code goes here;`  
        `} while (i<1);`  

**Loops keywords:**
    - **break** - will terminate the loop and go to the next statement of code outside the loop;  
    - **continue** - tells the interpreter to continue with the current iteration, and then checks the condition again (if it's true, the code will run again).  

`*` if the condition never returns false - you'll get the *infinite loop*.
