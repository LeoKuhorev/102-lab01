# Hey, here's my test page basing on the Lab 01 "Learning Markdown"

## *A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning*

## *By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort*


**To keep myself in a growth mindsed i should:**
- accept new challenges as learnig new stuff is fun!
- keep working hard as this is the only way to achieve more;
- get inspired by other's success as if I work hard I'll be there one day as well.
