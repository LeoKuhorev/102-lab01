**GROWTH vs FIXED MINDSET**

*A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning*
*By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort*

- accept new challenges as learnig new stuff is fun!
- keep working hard as this is the only way to achieve more;
- get inspired by other's success as if I work hard I'll be there one day as well.

**What challenges I've overcome to keep myself in a growth mindset?**

**COMMAND LINE/TERMINAL/SHELL**

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
The command line typically presents you with a prompt. Then you can enter a command (ls, pwd, cd etc). The command can be followed by arguments separated by spaces (eg -l /home/ryan ). The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ). 

**COMMAND LIST:**
- **_pwd_** (Print Working Directory) - tells you whar directorey you're at;
- **_ls_** (List) - lists what is in the current location;
     **OPTIONS:**
    - **_-l_** - long listing

    1 - d (directory), - (file);
    2 - permissions;
    3 - block numbers;
    4 - directory owner;
    5 - group;
    6 - directory/file size;
    7 - last edited;
    8 - directory/file name.
    - **_/etc_** - lists not the curren directory but instead that directories contents;
    - you can also combine them (_ls -l /etc_ - will show long listing of directories contents).
- **_cd_** (Change Directory) - changes your current location (*cd Documents*, *cd ~/Documents*, *cd /*);
- **_code_** - open VS Code (or whatever text editor you set it up for);
- **_cd $wr_** - brings to Windows FS root foldel;
- **_cdwr_** - in our particular */.profile* (this file stores terminal's profile settings) brings to Windows FS root;
- **_cd ~_** - brings to Linux FS root;
- **_cd /mnt_** - go to drives list;
- **_sudo apt-get upgrade_** - get updates.

**PATHS: ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE**

The very top of Linux hierarchical structure is /ROOT (/).
- **_~(tilde)_** - home directory (~/Documents = home/ryan/Documents);
- **_.(dot)_** - current directory (./Documents = Documents);
- **_..(dotdot)_** - parent directory (../../ will bring you 2 directories above the one you're in).
