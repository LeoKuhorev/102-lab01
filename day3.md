**VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM AND GIT**

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
- **VCS** - Version Control System;
- **CVCS** - Centralized VCS;
- **DVCS** - Distributed VCS.


Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.

**HOW TO SET UP YOUR PROJECT THROUGH GIT**

- *git clone URL (clone button on GitHub)* - you should only do it once for evety project;
- *git status* - if filename is red, then it needs to be updated;
- *git add --all (or filename)*;
- *git status* - file name(s) should be green now;
- *git commit -m "message that makes some sense to you"*;
- *git push origin master*.
